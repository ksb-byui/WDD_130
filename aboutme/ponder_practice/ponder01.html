<!--This is the framework of a beginning HTML page. Notice inside the body tag we have 3 general 
areas. The body tag has 3 children tags of header, main and footer. Let's start with the header. 
Let's type in a common element you'd find in the header a nav element

  <header>
    <nav></nav>
  </header>

  <!--The nav element will contain menu links. These links are created with an a tag

<nav>
  <a>Church of Jesus Christ</a>
  <a>Temples</a>
  <a>Scriptures</a>
</nav>

<!--If we look at our rendered page now in a browser window, the content of the a tag shows but they are
 not links. When we click on the content text, nothing happens. We have to add an attribute to the 
 opening a tag that shows where to take the user when they click on the content. Let's also add a 
 Home page link and then add attributes to each opening tag as follows.

<a href="byui.html">Home</a>
<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org">Church of Jesus Christ</a>
<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples">Temples</a>
<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures">Scriptures</a>

<!--Now when you look at the rendered page in the browser you can click the text content and it will take
 you to the right place because we added the href or hypertext reference value for each a link.

Note
Note that the links here are not going to internal website pages but to external website pages.
 Your navigation link would usually be going to other pages in your website not to outside web 
 pages like this.

Example Continued
Let's move on to the main part of our web page with a header level one title for our page using
 an h1 tag. Then let's add an img tag. There are two attributes needed for an image. First where 
 is the image located or what is the source (src) and, second what is some alternative text (alt) 
that can be used if the image can't be seen. Then add a paragraph beneath the title using a p tag.

<main>
  <h1>Brigham Young University Idaho</h1>
  <img
    src="https://www.byui.edu/images/service-sites/map-banner.jpg"
    alt="BYUI Campus"
  />
  <p>BYU-Idaho is a comfortable place to learn and grow as a disciple of Jesus Christ because 
    students, faculty, and employees share a commitment to live the gospel.</p>
  </main>

<!--Note
Again, we are using an attribute value for the src property that is taking us to an image that is 
located externally to our site. Normally you would want to use an internal path to your own images 
folder where your website images are located. Something like src="images/map-banner.jpg" This would 
assume that you have a folder called images with a jpg image called 'map-banner.jpg' located in that 
images folder of your site. But for ease of this prepare practice we will use the external image.

Example Continued
Lastly, let's add a p tag to our footer with a bit of information for the bottom of our page.

<footer>
  <p>My Web Page 20XX ©</p>
</footer>
The &copy; will create an HTML symbol copyright entity for us. See HTML Symbols for more examples.

<!--There we have our first simple HTML page. If we had multiple page that we created for the same 
website, the header and footer section would remain the same for every page of our website and the 
main section would change from page to page of our website.

We've practiced with some of the elements that make up the structure of a simple web page. And we
 see that some elements need attributes within their opening tags to display and function properly.-->
