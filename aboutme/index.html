    <h2>My name is Kole Bauer</h2>
    <h3>Friends call me Kole Boy</h3></center>

    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">I am studying software engineering at BYUI, attending a mix of in-person and online classes. 
    In my free time, I fish the Teton River and Henry's Lake, work on my vehicles, camp, and watch 
    Formula One. I've recently started learning to read and write in Python and I'm really enjoying 
    it! I am the youngest of my four siblings and the only boy. Suffice it to say, I am my parents' 
    favorite son and my sisters' favorite brother.</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Currently, I work on the family farm and do bookwork for my parents' businesses. I'm new to 
    the tech/software engineering field but I have some experience in finance and energy systems.
    Software is definitely a big change for me but I'm loving the classes that I have so far and hope
    to land somewhere that brings the tech and finance worlds together. I really love the environment
    of the BYUI campus and the diversity and accessibility that the online degree system has introduced.
    I am pursuing a B.S. in SWE with people from all over the world!</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">I think that a big advantage to learning about web design is the current and likely future job 
    availability in all things tech. In all honesty, my main reason for taking this course is that it's
    required for my major. That being said, I'd likely take it as an elective because I find web 
    development quite interesting and I think it's a fantastic tool for anyone in any field to have.</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">I have been a member of the church since I was baptized at 8 years old. One of my favorite quotes 
    is instead a conference talk by President Monson from October of 1986 when he was the second counselor 
    in the first presidency. One of my early church leaders shared it in Sunday school with us and it has been
    my favorite talk ever since. The title is, "Courage Counts." My favorite scripture is 1 Nephi 3:7.</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">I am looking forward to meeting, learning, and growing with you all and I hope that we can all
    have a successful semester!</p>
