      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>For my personal project, I am planning to make a multi-purpose
         Personal Portfolio Website. The primary purpose of my website 
         will be to link to my resume to provide additional information 
         about me, as well as a repository of projects I have worked on 
         and definitely want potential employers to see.  I'd possibly 
         include a link/links to another site that could host other pet 
         projects that I don't necessarily want to advertise to the 
         employers but that I wouldn't mind having them see if they were 
         interested.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience is interviewers and potential employers.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This will be the page that the user lands on when clicking my website's link.
        As it may be a potential employer that would be landing here, I want to keep 
        it quite simple and professional while displaying an obvious path to my
        "For Employers" page, but also having a path to personal projects that I am
        proud of and that demonstrate my skills in case the employers would be interested 
        in seeing these, or if a general user wants access to my open source projects.
        This page will include: Simple navigation bar with logo, "contact me," 
        "about me" paragraph, photo of me, my "why?" statement, footer with links to 
        social media/professional media.
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
        <img src="images/PortHeadshot.png" alt="professional picture of me">
        <img src="images/portBack.png" alt="background picture">

      </ul>
      <h3>For Employers</h3>
      <p>
        This page will be no nonsense access to information that would be important
        to a potential employer such as work experience, certifications, licensure,
        unofficial transcript, references, etc. I'm undecided wether to make it a 
        display of my resume formatted to fit a screen or to have a link to my resume 
        document, unofficial transcript, linkedin, etc. Regardless, I'll likely 
        include simple photos that act as dividers for the information.

      <h3>Personal Projects</h3>
      <p>
        This page will be available to anyone who accesses my home page. It will mainly 
        be a place where I can show off my coolest projects but it could also be a place 
        for employers to get an idea of what skills I have and how I've applied them. It
        can also be a place for interested people to access my 3D files or code to copy and
        use or edit to their liking. I could also do write-ups on the projects and provide
        links to equipment or materials I used.
