                        <p>Our trip with Dry Oar was unforgettable to say the least! Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and professional. She took us on some class V rapids, and not once were any of us worried about a capsize! I'd absolutely recommend Dry Oar to anyone of any experience level. You won't regret it!</p>

                        <p>Dry Oar put together a fantastic experience for our family. We had never been rafting before and they set us up for a beginner trip with the option of taking a rougher line on our last day. The campsite was top-notch and very well maintained. Our guide was very patient with us and helped us all overcome our fear of the fast-moving water when we opted for the scarier rapids on the last day! My only complaint is the mosquito bites, but each one brings back a fond memory of our adventure. If you're looking to go on your first rafting trip, do not hesitate to book with Dry Oar!!</p>
